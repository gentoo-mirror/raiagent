This tiny project provides a convenient, compact, pre-packaged and comprehensively documented suite of command line option parsers for the use of Java programmers. Initially, parsing compatible with GNU-style 'getopt' is provided.

Why use JArgs rather than other similar libraries? Because it's easy to use, thoroughly tested, well documented and liberally licenced (BSD licence so no GNU messiness).

The package is small and without frills, but is functional, and contains code that has been in production use for quite some time.
