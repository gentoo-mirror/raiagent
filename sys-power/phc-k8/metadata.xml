		PHC-K8 driver for the Linux PHC (Processor Hardware Control) project by David Gaarenstroom.
		For AMD processors, there are (as of this writing) two types of processors that can be
		undervolted:
		1. AMD K8 based processors with a single frequency/voltage CPU register. Examples of these
		   kind of processors are AMD Athlon and AMD Neo processors. If /proc/cpuinfo enlists your
		   processor(s) with a cpu_family less than 16, then your processor is from this category.
		2. AMD K10 based processors with "Hardware Power State" registers. Examples of these kind
		   of processors are AMD Phenom and AMD Turion X2 processors. If /proc/cpuinfo enlists
		   your processor(s) with a cpu_family equal to 16 or 17, then your processor is from this
		   category.
		So even though the regular driver for AMD processors is called "powernow-k8" and this
		driver is called "phc-k8", these drivers supports both K8 and K10 processors! K8
		undervolting has been supported for a while and offers more features than K10 undervolting
		does at the moment. K10 support is still a bit immature.
