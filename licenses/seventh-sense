To use this software or source code, you must agree to abide by the following license restrictions:

1) You may NOT distribute the Seventh Sense program (binaries, unmodified source code, or the entire contents of the data folder) from any location but the Project Aon website. This is in keeping with the Project Aon license.

2) You may NOT distribute copyrighted images contained in the data folder (mostly map images, as well as some illustrations).

3) You MAY use any portion of the source code as a basis for your own software project, provided it is not named "Seventh Sense", gives proper credit to the original author (David Olsen), and does not play the Project Aon editions of the Lone Wolf series (books 1-20) written by Joe Dever. Upon my untimely death, all of those restrictions are lifted, because I really won't care at that point.

4) You MAY modify the source code for your own personal use, and you are WELCOME to submit any modifications/improvements to the author for inclusion in future releases. (Please remember restrictions #1 and #3 in regards to distributing your changes.)

5) These restrictions extend to any of the Seventh Sense code used in another project. If you use my code, please make sure that your project contains these restrictions as well.


Basically, you are welcome to do what you want with the source code, as long as you don't just do the exact same thing I did with it! I would be happy to see the code used a basis for other gamebook readers, for example the Grey Star the Wizard series, or the New Order of the Kai(books 21-28).
