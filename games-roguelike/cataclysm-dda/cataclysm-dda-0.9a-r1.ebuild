#FIXME: C:DDA ships with an undocumented and currently unsupported
# 
#"CMakeLists.txt" for building under CMake. Switch to such makefile when
#confirmed to be reliably working.

# Post-0.9 versions of C:DDA employ capitalized alphabetic letters rather than
# numbers (e.g., "0.A" rather than "1.0"). Since Portage permits version
# specifiers to contain only a single suffixing letter prefixed by one or more
# digits, we encode post-0.9 versions as "0.9${lowercase_letter}" in the ebuild
# filename and then manually strip the "9" and uppercase such letter here.
