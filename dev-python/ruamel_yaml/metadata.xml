ruamel.yaml is a YAML package for Python. It is a derivative of Kirill Simonov's PyYAML 3.11 which supports YAML1.1. Major differences with PyYAML 3.11 include:

* integrated Python 2 and 3 sources, running on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.
* round trip mode that includes comments (block mode, key ordering kept)
* support for simple lists as mapping keys by transformation to tuples
* !!omap generates ordereddict (C) on Python 2, collections.OrderedDict on Python 3, and !!omap is generated for these types.
* some YAML 1.2 enhancements (0o octal prefix, \/ escape)
* pep8 compliance
* tox and py.test based testing
* currently assumes that the C yaml library is installed. That library doesn't generate CommentTokens, so it cannot be used to do round trip editing on comments. It can be used for normal processing (no need to install ruamel.yaml and PyYaml)
