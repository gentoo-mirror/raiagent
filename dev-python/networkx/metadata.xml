    NetworkX is a Python-based package for the creation, manipulation, and
    study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
    The structure of a graph or network is encoded in the edges (connections,
    links, ties, arcs, bonds) between nodes (vertices, sites, actors). If
    unqualified, by graph we mean a simple undirected graph, i.e. no
    self-loops and no multiple edges are allowed. By a network we usually
    mean a graph with weights (fields, properties) on nodes and/or edges.
    The potential audience for NetworkX includes: mathematicians, physicists,
    biologists, computer scientists, social scientists.
