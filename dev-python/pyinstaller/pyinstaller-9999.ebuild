#FIXME: Add support for command-line options accepted by "bootloader/wscript",
#run by the call to waf-utils_src_configure() below (e.g., "--leak-detector",
#"--clang"). Also add a "debug" USE flag for switching between release and
#debug builds.

#FIXME: Interestingly, PyInstaller itself has no hard or soft dependencies
#excluding the expected build-time dependency of "setuptools". Its unit tests,
#however, require an elaborate set of pure-Python packages, C-based Python
#extensions, and system-wide shared libraries. It's fairly extreme --
#sufficiently extreme, in fact, that we do *NOT* currently bother. For an
#exhaustive list of such dependencies, see "tests/test-requirements.txt".
