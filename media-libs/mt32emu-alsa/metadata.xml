Running mt32d will provide two ports 128:0 and 128:1 provided that it is the
only soft-synth running. When trying to play MT-32 midi streams use ALSA port
128:0. 128:1 attempts to emulate general midi support using the MT-32 mode, try
it for a laugh. Run mt32d with the -h parameter to get a list and description
of the other parameters.

Running mt32d as root user will allow program to use real-time scheduling which
may reduce/remove drop outs as the program can use the CPU more aggressively.
