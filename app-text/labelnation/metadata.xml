LabelNation is a command-line program for making labels: address labels, business cards, or anything else involving regularly-arranged rectangles on a printer-ready sheet. It is for users who are comfortable dealing with text- and option-based configuration, as opposed to a graphical user interface. LabelNation is free / open source software, written in Python, and licenced under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).
