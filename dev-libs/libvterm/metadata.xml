An abstract C99 library which implements a VT220 or xterm-like terminal
emulator. It doesn't use any particular graphics toolkit or output system,
instead it invokes callback function pointers that its embedding program should
provide it to draw on its behalf. It avoids calling malloc() during normal
running state, allowing it to be used in embedded kernel situations.
