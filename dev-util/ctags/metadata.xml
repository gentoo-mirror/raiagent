Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-underused
ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of all ctags programs. It
generates indexes of source code definitions which are used by a number of
editors and tools. The motivation which drove the development of Exuberant
Ctags was the need for a ctags program which supported generation of tags
for all possible C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and
because most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

Exuberant Ctags offers the following features:

1.  It supports the following languages: Assembler, AWK, ASP, BETA,
    Bourne/Korn/Z Shell, C, C++, C#, COBOL, Eiffel, Erlang, Fortran, Java, Lisp,
    Lua, Makefile, Objective-C, Pascal, Perl, PHP, PL/SQL, Python, REXX, Ruby,
    Scheme, S-Lang, SML (Standard ML), Tcl, Vera, Verilog, VHDL, Vim,
    and YACC.

2.  It is capable of generating tags for virtually all C language constructs.

3.  It is very robust in parsing code. In particular, the C/C++ parser is
    far less easily fooled by code containing #if preprocessor conditional
    constructs, using a conditional path selection algorithm to resolve
    complicated situations, and a fall-back algorithm when this one fails.

4.  Supports output of Emacs-style TAGS files (i.e. "etags").

5.  User-defined languages, using Posix regular expressions.

6.  Supports UNIX, MSDOS, Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP, OS/2, QNX, Amiga, QDOS,
    RISC OS, VMS, Macintosh, and Cray. Some pre-compiled binaries are
    available on the web site.
